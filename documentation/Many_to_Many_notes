MANY TO MANY RELATIONS

	1. Create a new migration that will be the resulting table from the N-M relationship between the two entities (We don't need a model or a controller for this pivot table)
	2. Create the belongsToMany relations in the model of the two entities
	3. Ways to add and delete values from pivot tables

	    $user = \App\User::first();
	    $projects = \App\Project::all();

        $user->projectsBelongTo()->attach($projects); //Adding $projects. Posibility of duplicating rows.
        $user->projectsBelongTo()->detach($projects); //Deleting $projects
        $user->projectsBelongTo()->sync($projects); //Substitute all user projects for $projects array
        $user->projectsBelongTo()->syncWithoutDetaching($projects); //Add only the new projects (those that are not already inserted). This avoids duplicates.

        $userProjects = User::first()->projectsBelongTo()->get();

    4. Data can be accessed from user (projects of that user) or from projects (users of that project)
